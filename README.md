# RealityCoin Public Monorepo

This repository contains the public RealityCoin code. It will grow as we continue open sourcing more components of the system.

## Projects

- [Preview Canvas](./preview_canvas/): an admin tool for overlaying RealityCoin blocks on an OSM base layer and performing various analyses.
- [Validator Consensus](./validator_consensus/): v0 of the Solana program that validators connect to to vote whether to accept newly mined collections.
