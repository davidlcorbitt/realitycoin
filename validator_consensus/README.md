# RealityCoin Consensus Program

This repository contains a prototype consensus program for use with [RealityCoin](https://www.realitycoin.org/). The intention is to allow individuals holding RealityCoin to stake some tokens and become **validators**. Validators are responsible for reviewing each submitted collection of images and voting to approve or reject the collection.
